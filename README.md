# pyRefactor

Python3 refactor tool for C++/Python projects.

The script produces a file list from a given folder by searching through for all the user-defined file suffixes. This information is then used to analyze and build a database of variables, class names etc. Finally, this database can be fed to the script to do complete project-wise search and replace of those strings. This way one can do all the changes in one go, and easily unify the project variable naming.
